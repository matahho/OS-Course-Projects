Points :
- multiple sample provided in ./Sample
- BMP class added in parallel to make it fast .
- if you make each ./serial or ./parallel and then for serial : ./Serial.out "path/to/input/img" , for parallel : ./Parallel.out "path/to/input/img"
- ****for some reason you should first open image in photoshop and then save it and then you can input this to program ****
    - To save two zero bit and the end of .bmp file (open in photoshop and save it )
- if you run each program you can see detail time for each function
- mirror in parallel handeled in writing the bmp file (for more accurcy and speed)
- you can see ratio of speedup :
    - chmode +x result.sh
    - ./result.sh
    - it run 10 time and avarage
